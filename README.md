This project aims to predict whether a borrower will repay a loan or default, using machine learning classification techniques. The dataset includes features such as loan amount, interest rate, credit score, annual income, employment length, and debt-to-income ratio. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we performed exploratory data analysis to understand trends and relationships. The model was built using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms. Both models were evaluated using key classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Among them, the Random Forest model performed best, offering more accurate and reliable predictions. This model can assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk borrowers and improving loan approval processes. The project was developed using Python, with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Future enhancements include deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions through a user-friendly interface.
